Steps to run SaveIT:

Project Code:  https://github.com/spatole12/SaveIT.git
User Testing Video Link:  https://drive.google.com/file/d/19rIqU74j5U8TQ4Ogj6HOGFZu-ObdaUGh/view?usp=sharing
Steps to run the code:
1.	To run our code first make sure that “node js” is installed. Below is the link to download and install node js
 	https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2.	After installing node js, make sure that mongoDB is installed. As we are using mongoDB to store the data. Below is the link to install monogoDB on Windows and macOS
Windows - https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/
macOS - https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/
3.	After installing mongoDB and node js, open terminal in mac or command prompt in windows and navigate to the folder where the project files are present. Once navigated to the folder, we have to first start the mongoDB server, and to do that we have to use the command:
Johndoe-MacBook-Pro:~ allan$ mongod
That is, we make use of “mongod” command to start the mongo server.
4.	After mongo server is started, open new terminal window or command prompt window and again navigate to the folder where project files are present.
5.	Run the command “node app”, and this will run the program and you will get the following lines on terminal:
“body-parser deprecated undefined extended: provide extended option app.js:11:20
We've now got a server!
Your routes will be running on http://localhost:4000”
6.	Once you get that message, it means that the code is now in running state.
7.	Open google chrome and in the url field type “http://localhost:4000”.
8.	You will get a login screen, and there enter your email address. When the goal is 100% completed you will get the email which is given on login screen.
9.	Enter the username and password as “Administrator” or “administrator” as we have designed it for one user.
10.	Now you are ready to use the application.
